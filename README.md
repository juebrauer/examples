| Example  | What's that? |
| :------- | :----------- |
| 001      | Python script, shows how to generate a PDF file from Python with graphics |
| 002      | Python script, shows the difference between full batch vs. SGD vs. mini-batch gradient descent |
| 003      | Python script, which I use to generate short .mp4 videos with title text for (family) videos |
| 004      | Notebook, building a Keras MLP for house price prediction. Linear model and MLP have similar performance. |
| 005      | Notebook, finetuning a VLM (Gemma 3) for converting LaTeX formula images to LaTeX formulas |
| 006      | Notebook, building a Keras MLP for concrete strength prediction. MLP is superior to linear model. |

| 010      | Notebook, introducing BigData topics as Pandas chunking, Parquet files, etc. |
| 011      | Notebook, showing uni- and multi-variate techniques for outlier detection and removal |
| 012      | Python script, interactive DBSCAN demo. You can define data points and cluster them |
| 013      | C and C++ examples, demonstrating various concepts in C and C++ |
| 014      | Python script, compares different optimizers like GD, Momentum, Nesterov, Adagrad, RMSProp, Adam, AdamW, Lion |
| 015      | Notebook, demonstrates how to do AutoML on tabular data with AutoGluon TabularPredictor and TimeSeriesPredictor |
| 016      | Notebook, short intro to Dask - a Python library for working with big data files |
| 017      | Notebook, shows how to create a SQLite3 database, retrieve data, change data |
| 018      | Notebook, very short notebook that shows how to load in gpt-oss with 20b params and classify a user question (in German) |
| 019      | Notebook, mini RAG example with Chroma vector store and OpenAI API (in German) |
| 020      | Notebook, anomaly detection in ECG data with the help of an autoencoder built with Keras (in German) |
| 021      | Python scripts, simple 2D (n-DOF) robot arm simulator and models that learn to control the robot arm |
