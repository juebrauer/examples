| Example  | What's that? |
| :------- | :----------- |
| 001      | Python script, shows how to generate a PDF file from Python with graphics |
| 002      | Python script, shows the difference between full batch vs. SGD vs. mini-batch gradient descent |
| 003      | Python script, which I use to generate short .mp4 videos with title text for (family) videos |
| 004      | Notebook, that shows how to build a Keras MLP for house price prediction. Linear model and MLP have similar performance. |
| 005      | Notebook, that shows how to finetune a VLM (Gemma 3) for converting LaTeX formula images to LaTeX formulas |
| 006      | Notebook, that shows how to build a Keras MLP for concrete strength prediction. MLP is superior to linear model. |
