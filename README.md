# Examples
Code examples: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Robotics, Programming, etc.


| Example  | What's that? |
| :------- | :----------- |
| 001      | Python script, shows how to generate a PDF file from Python with graphics |
| 002      | Python script, shows the difference between full batch vs. SGD vs. mini-batch gradient descent |
| 003      | Python script, which I use to generate short .mp4 videos with title text for (family) videos |
| 004      | Notebook, building a Keras MLP for house price prediction. Linear model and MLP have similar performance. |
| 005      | Notebook, finetuning a VLM (Gemma 3) for converting LaTeX formula images to LaTeX formulas |
| 006      | Notebook, building a Keras MLP for concrete strength prediction. MLP is superior to linear model. |
| 007      | Notebook, demonstrating a k-fold CV for a MLP |
| 008      | Notebook, finetuning a VLM (Qwen 3, 8b) for classifying and describing monster images |
| 009      | Notebook, finetuning a LLM (Llama 3.2, 3b) to know new facts (here: about a specific person) |
| 010      | Notebook, introducing BigData topics as Pandas chunking, Parquet files, etc. |
| 011      | Notebook, showing uni- and multi-variate techniques for outlier detection and removal |
| 012      | Python script, interactive DBSCAN demo. You can define data points and cluster them |
| 013      | C and C++ examples, demonstrating various concepts in C and C++ |
